<p>Dear Ada Developers Academy, <br />
Please consider my application for a position in the Ada Developers Academy. I believe that my personal hobbies, <br />
education and work history make me a great candidate for a position in the Ada program. As personal hobbies go, <br />
I enjoy puzzles, video games, working on my car and making things. The most satisfying thing to me about my <br />
hobbies is the trouble shooting, puzzle solving, and the reward of learning something new. In high school I had <br />
engineering and science classes. I’ve been introduced to the main fields of physical sciences. In engineering <br />
I did projects using CAD programs and other software for making programs for machines I built. I learned how to <br />
make a program for a marble sorter I built out of Lego’s, sensors and a milk container. Where work is concerned <br />
I have been working for about 12 years. I've worked in food, a photonics lab, and I currently work as a manager <br />
at an auto parts store. A few reasons that I've found these different areas of work interesting are the <br />
different types of challenges and solutions, and seeing what the results are. Every day I practice brainstorming, <br />
diagnostics, and research to provide the customer with an end product.  </p>
